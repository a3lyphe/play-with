Changes

2010-06-21:
	--renamed 'Schiffrennen 16' work-folder into 'Amnesty'
	--'Amnesty' is now working title
	--versioned renaming of original 'Schiffrennen.16.htm' into 'Amnesty.0.0.17.2010.06.21.htm'
	--pulled script from 'Core/Core.Welt.js' (class.JS:Welt) into the script-section of 'Amnesty.0.0.17.2010.06.21.htm' (main file|index.htm) to check for possible different errors if rendered inside (due to global variable conflicts|render time)
	--tried to set DOCTYPE to html 5 via <!DOCTYPE html>; leads to massive css|style-positioning errors for top|left-values which are not localizable exactly; so switched back to original without DOCTYPE
	--sorted out methods in Welt-Class to prototype them, because of process- and memory-efficiency; prototyping is much faster then inside-method-declaration and has the benefit, that any instance gets the methods independent of initialization time and at least prototyped methods are much more valuable due to the fact, that they are calculated once; If methods are defined inside constructor-functions|JS-Classes they are calculated and saved as individual function-sets for any generated instance.
	--checked for correct closing of lines via semi-colon;should now be correctly closed (around 60 semi-colons added)
	--checked for correct nesting and bracelets-positioning; bracelets now are set as blocks for definitions and cameled for calls
	--generated Amnesty.0.0.17.2010.06.21.Welt.js; pushed the refined Core/Core.Welt.js-script-section back from the 'Amnesty.0.0.18.2010.06.21.htm' to this external file
	--duplicated 'Amnesty.0.0.17.2010.06.21.Welt.js' and stepped up to Version 0.0.18; added DONE and TODO comment-section
	//class:Welt

	//Core/Core.Welt.js
		//DONE:

			//+file-name versioned
			//+prototyped methods
			//+nested correctly
			//+line-endings are semi-colonized
			//+bracelets are corrected
			//+double defined variable wo is commented
		//TODO:
			//+del alert('hulu')
			//+NameSpace
			//+var wo - delete comments if functionality is given; check why definition is doubled
			//+var wo und $(Isleid) is the same - merge to one
			//+merge document.getElementById and $() - it is the same - only one coding-style should be there
			//+var nummer is build via: var nummer=iZahl+1; -- should be iZahl++;
			//+var nummer has always 2 values which are any time the same sequence - seems to depend on the if it is nested in (check relation to iZahl)
	--duplicated 'Amnesty.0.0.18.2010.06.21.htm' and stepped up to Version 0.0.19:
